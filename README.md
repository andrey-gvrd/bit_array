This library allows to save an array of binary values in the most efficient way possible
using macros on a conventional array of a known type.

Use the array type appropriate for your system for optimal performace, or use
a byte-sized type for minimising wasted space.

The whole library is a bunch of macros in 'src/bit_array.h'. Example of using it is in 'examples/'.
